    1. A concrete subclass of `AbstractState` that defines the PyTree
        structure of the full model state. The fields may be types of
        `AbstractState`, in the case of nested models.
    2. A concrete subclass of this class with:
        i. the appropriate components for doing state transformations;
        either `eqx.Module`/`AbstractModel`-typed fields, or instance methods,
        each with the signature `input, state, *, key`; ii. a `model_spec`
        property that specifies a series of named operations on parts of the
        full model state, using those component modules; and iii. an `init`
        method that returns an initial model state.
            
    The motivation behind the level of abstraction of this class is that it
    gives a name to each functional stage of a composite model, so that after 
    model instantiation or training, the user can choose to insert additional 
    state interventions to be executed prior to any of the named stages.
