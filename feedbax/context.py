        For example, `fbx.Recursion` stores trajectories of states, however it
        doesn't usually make sense to store `states.feedback.queue` for every
        timestep, because it contains info that is already available to
        `Recursion` if `states.mechanics` is stored at every timestep. If the
        feedback delay is 5 steps, `Recursion` will end up with 5 extra copies
        of all the parts of `states.mechanics` that are part of the feedback.

        logic of the feedback loop, i.e. that queue is just transient internal 
        memory of another variable in the loop.
