        but not the plant configuration state, this method should be used

        structure of the state, but also of the model interface that 
        provides particular operations for modifying the state. Though, I'm not

        mirror the operations done on them anyway.
        
        However, this approach also has the advantage that these consistency
        checks can be arbitrarily complex and important to the model 
        functioning properly; it is useful for the model to be able to

           structure of the full model state. The fields may be types of 
           `AbstractModelState`, in the case of nested models.
        2. A concrete subclass of this class with:
            i. the appropriate components for doing state transformations;
            either `eqx.Module`/`AbstractModel`-typed fields, or instance 
            methods, each with the signature `input, state, *, key`;
            ii. a `model_spec` property that specifies a series of named 
            operations on parts of the full model state, using those component 
            modules; and
            iii. an `init` method that returns an initial model state.
            
    The motivation behind the level of abstraction of this class is that it
    gives a name to each functional stage of a composite model, so that after 
    model instantiation or training, the user can choose to insert additional 
    state interventions to be executed prior to any of the named stages.
