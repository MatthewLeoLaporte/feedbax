"""Composable loss function modules operating on state PyTrees.

TODO:

- The time aggregation could be done in `CompositeLoss`, if we unsqueeze
  terms that don't have a time dimension. This would allow time aggregation
  to be controlled in one place, if for some reason it makes sense to change
  how this aggregation occurs across all loss terms.
  - Actually I think the time aggregation should probably be left to the
    specific implementation; consider that we might want to do dynamic slicing
    and aggregation which involves vmapping over a function in which the time
    aggregation occurs.
- Protocols for all the different `state` types/fields?
    - Alternatively we could make `AbstractLoss` generic over a
      `StateT` typevar, however that might not make sense for typing
      the compositions (e.g. `__sum__`) since the composite can support any
      state pytrees that have the right combination of fields, not just pytrees
      that have an identical structure.

            with the weights of those simple terms multiplied by the weight
            given in `weights` for their parent composite term.

            If a composite term has a user-specified label, that label will be

                are used as term labels, instead of the `label` field of each term.
