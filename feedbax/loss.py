"""Composable loss function modules operating on state PyTrees.

TODO:

- `LossDict` only computes the total loss once, but when we append a `LossDict`
  for a single timestep to `losses_history` in `TaskTrainer`, we lose the loss
  total for that time step. When it is needed later (e.g. on plotting the loss)
  it will be recomputed, once. It is also not serialized along with the 
  `losses_history`. I doubt this is a significant computational loss 
  (how many loss terms * training iterations could be involved? 1e6?)
  to have to compute from time to time, but perhaps it would be nice to 
  include the total as part of flatten/unflatten. It'd probably just require
  that we allow passing the total on instantiation, however that would be kind
  of weird.
    - Even if we have 6 loss terms with 1e6 iterations, it only takes ~130 ms 
    to compute `losses.total`. Given that we only need to compute this once
    per session or so, it shouldn't be a problem.
- The time aggregation could be done in `CompositeLoss`, if we unsqueeze
  terms that don't have a time dimension. This would allow time aggregation
  to be controlled in one place, if for some reason it makes sense to change 
  how this aggregation occurs across all loss terms.
- Protocols for all the different `state` types/fields?
    - Alternatively we could make `AbstractLoss` generic over an 
      `AbstractState` typevar, however that might not make sense for typing
      the compositions (e.g. `__sum__`) since the composite can support any
      state pytrees that have the right combination of fields, not just pytrees
      that have an identical structure.
- L2 by default, but should allow for other norms
