For example, we can do `list(map(lambda x: x**2, some_list))` to get the same result as `tree_map(lambda x: x**2, some_list)`. However, `map` doesn't return the same data structure it is given: to square all the values in a dict, and return a dict like we did with `tree_map`, we'd have to do something like `dict(zip(some_dict.keys(), map(lambda x: x**2, some_dict.values())))`.
