# Getting started

Feedbax is a [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/beginner_guide.html#beginner-guide) library for optimal feedback control with neural networks.

Feedbax makes it easy to:

- [train](/feedbax/examples/0_train_simple) a neural network to control a simulated limb (biomechanical model) to perform movement tasks;
- [intervene](/feedbax/examples/3_intervening) on existing models and tasks—for example, to:
    - add force fields that disturb a limb;
    - alter the activity of a single unit in a neural network;
    - perturb the sensory feedback received by a network;
    - add any kind of noise to any part of a model's state;
- schedule an intervention to occur on only a subset of task trials or time steps;
- specify which parts of the model are [trainable](/feedbax/examples/1_train/#selecting-part-of-the-model-to-train), and which states are available as sensory feedback;
- train [multiple replicates](/feedbax/examples/4_vmap) of a model at once;
- swap out components of models, and write new components.
<!-- - track the progress of a training run in Tensorboard. -->

!!! Warning ""
    Feedbax is currently in active [development](#development). Expect some changes in the near future!

??? Note "What Feedbax can (and can't) do"
    Feedbax is designed for feedback control of biomechanical models by neural networks, to perform movement tasks in continuous spaces. However, it could also be used for other optimal control problems for which a suitable set of model, cost function, and task trials can be defined.

    Feedbax is *not* designed for finding algebraic solutions to the classic formalisms of optimal control theory, such as the [Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear%E2%80%93quadratic%E2%80%93Gaussian_control) (LQG) controller. Similarly, Feedbax does not enforce the [separation principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_principle) between model components—that is, models don't *need* to include distinct components (e.g. neural network layers) for the controller and the observer (i.e. state estimator).

## Feedbax is a JAX library

Feedbax uses JAX and [Equinox](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/).

[Never used JAX before](/feedbax/examples/pytrees/)?
<!--
One disadvantage of JAX is a lack of GPU support on Windows, though it is possible to use the GPU through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). -->

Please also check out [MotorNet](https://github.com/OlivierCodol/MotorNet), a PyTorch library with many similarities to Feedbax.

## Installation

`pip install feedbax`

Currently requires Python>=3.11.

For best performance, [install JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) with GPU support.

## Development

I've developed Feedbax over the last few months, while learning JAX. My short-term objective has been to support my own use cases—graduate research in the neuroscience of motor control—but I've also tried to design something reusable and general.

I've added GitHub [issues](https://github.com/mlprt/feedbax/issues) to document some of my choices and uncertainties. For an overview of major issues in different categories, check out [this GitHub conversation](https://github.com/mlprt/feedbax/discussions/27). Refer also to [this page](/feedbax/examples/structure) of the docs, for an informal overview of how Feedbax objects relate to each other.

There are many features, especially pre-built models and tasks, that could still be implemented. Some of the models and tasks that *are* implemented, have yet to be fully optimized. So far I've focused more on the overall structure, than on coverage of all the common use cases I can imagine. If there's a particular model, task, or feature you'd like Feedbax to support, [let us know](https://github.com/mlprt/feedbax/issues), or contribute some code!
