# State PyTrees

!!! Note    
    State PyTrees that are operated on by specific model types are located alongside their respective types. 
    
    For example, [`MechanicsState`][feedbax.mechanics.MechanicsState] is defined in the same module as 
    [`Mechanics`][feedbax.mechanics.Mechanics].

::: feedbax.state.AbstractState

::: feedbax.state.StateT
    options:
        separate_signature: true
        signature_crossrefs: true

::: feedbax.state.StateBounds

::: feedbax.state.CartesianState

::: feedbax.state.clip_state
